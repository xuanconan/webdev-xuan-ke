# Self introduction

Hi I'm Ke Xuan. Friends call me Conan since I hit the gym five times a week. I got my MBA with concentration in 
finance last year. Then I decided to purchase my second master degree in computer science as I plan to work
in the FinTech field in my future career. 

I was admitted by the align CS program. Coding is new to me but I surely feel the power of it and how it can 
dramatically change the future of finance. Currently I'm a TA in finance department and a stunent in general CS.
